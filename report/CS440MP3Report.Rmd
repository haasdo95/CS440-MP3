# Part 1: Digit Classification

## Single Pixels as Features (For Everybody)

### Implementation

We treated this problem as a special case of *pixel group as features* where the pixel groups are simply disjoint and of size 1 by 1. Please see the next section for details.  

### Smoothing Constant

### Classification Rate and Confusion Matrix

### Posterior Probabilities: Highest and Lowest

### Visualization of Likelihoods and Odds Ratios

## Pixel Groups as Features (For Four-Credit Students)

### Accuracy on Test Set

```{r}
sizes_to_run_disj <- c(11, 22, 24, 42, 22)
sizes_to_run_overlap <- c(22, 24, 42, 44, 23, 32, 33)
for (kernel.size in sizes_to_run_disj) {
  i <- kernel.size %/% 10
  j <- kernel.size %% 10
  path.to.file <- paste("img/conf_mat_disj", kernel.size, ".png", sep = "")
  print(path.to.file)
  knitr::include_graphics(path = path.to.file)
}
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/conf_mat_disj11.png")

```

### Trends for Different Feature Sets

### Running Time for Different Feature Sets

#### Training

#### Testing

## Extra Credit

### Ternary Features

### Naive Bayes Classifier on Face Data

# Part 2: Audio Classification

## Binary Classification: Hebrew words of "yes" and "no" (For Everybody)

### Implementation

### Classification Rate and Confusion Matrix

## Multi-Class Classification: Audio Digits 1-5 Spoken by Four Different Speakers (For Four-Credit Students)

### Implementation

### Overall Accuracy

### Classification Rate and Confusion Matrix

## Extra Credit

### Binary Classification on Unsegmented Data

### Alternative Method (RNN) on XXX Data

### Average-Column Method on Hebrew Yes-No Corpus
