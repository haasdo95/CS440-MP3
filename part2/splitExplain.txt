split function first strips garbage data at the beginning and the end of a voice data. Then iterates the rest of the data. When the number of high energy grid is more than startThreshold, start recording data. When the number of high energy grid is less than endThreshold, or when the time limit is exceeded (10 columns), stop recording data. If the data is not long enough (less than 10 columns), use all zero column to pad two side of that data to 10 columns.
